## Verify that integration_config was specified
- block:
  - assert:
      that:
        - this_node_connection_string is defined
        - port is defined
        - type is defined
        - mode is defined
        - interface_id is defined
        - new_port is defined

## Validate the create interface module
- block:
  - name: "Create Interface"
    thales.ciphertrust.interface_save:
      localNode: "{{ this_node_connection_string }}"
      op_type: create
      port: "{{ port }}"
      auto_registration: false
      interface_type: "{{ type }}"
      mode: "{{ mode }}"
      network_interface: all
    register: _result_create

  - assert:
      that:
        - _result_create is not failed
        - _result_create.response.id is string

## Validate the patch interface module
- block:
  - name: "Patch User"
    thales.ciphertrust.usermgmt_users_save:
      op_type: "patch"
      op_type: patch
      interface_id: "{{ interface_id }}"
      port: "{{ new_port }}"
      localNode: "{{ this_node_connection_string }}"
    register: _result_patch

  - assert:
      that:
        - _result_patch is not failed
        - _result_patch.response.message is match("Resource updated succesfully")
